# üìπ Smart CCTV Surveillance System with YOLOv8

This is a Flask-based intelligent CCTV surveillance system that integrates the **YOLOv8** object detection model to monitor video streams in real-time. The system detects **humans and/or animals**, records footage, and sends **email alerts with intrusion snapshots** upon detecting suspicious activity.
